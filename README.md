- cc can compile the c file, the embedded utf8 string prints correctly

- Unicode cmake project name is fine

- CMake can't use unicode for target names

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3 (add_executable):
  The target name "héllòmün" is reserved or not valid for certain CMake
  features, such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined
  behavior.
```
