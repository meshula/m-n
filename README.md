- cc can compile the c file, the embedded utf8 string prints correctly

- Unicode cmake project name is fine

- CMake can't use unicode for target names

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3 (add_executable):
  The target name "héllòmün" is reserved or not valid for certain CMake
  features, such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined
  behavior.
```

- unicode filename for c file is fine in cmake

Can't add unicode filename to git

```
git add "h\303\251ll\303\262m\303\274\303\261.c"
fatal: pathspec 'h\303\251ll\303\262m\303\274\303\261.c' did not match any files
```
